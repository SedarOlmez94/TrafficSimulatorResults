Four Jupyter notebooks are provided. These are:
single_scenario_analysis
normalized_collisions
speed_analysis
Spatial_Visualisations_Magnitude_VLocation

single_scenario_analysis: Analyses all runs for a single scenario.
This produces all single-scenario plots, and the aggregate values used in multi-scenario plots.
Aggregate values were added manually to the following files:
normalized_average_collisions2.csv
flow_measurements2.csv
speed_analysis.ods


normalized_collisions: Produces plot for number of collisions against non-adherence level (Figure 4).
Uses data from normalized_average_collisions2.csv


speed_analysis: Produces plot for average speed against number of vehicles (Figure 5)
Uses data from flow_measurements2.csv

Spatial analysis of velocity magnitude and vehicle locations: the python notebook used to visualise 
vehicles locations and their magnitude can be found in the Spatial_Visualisations_Magnitude_VLocation.ipynb notebook.
The results from this analysis is located in the Spatial_Results folder.


The results from speed_analysis.ods are the results from Table 4 (average speed, spread, vehicles under 5mp).
